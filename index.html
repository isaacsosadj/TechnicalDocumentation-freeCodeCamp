          HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of
          the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other
          technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web
          page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior
          (JavaScript).
        </p>

        <p>
          "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another,
          either within a single website or between websites. Links are a
          fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet
          and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an
          active participant in the World Wide Web.
        </p>

        <p>
          An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags",
          which consist of the element name surrounded by "<" and ">" . The name of an element inside a tag is case
            insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the < title> tag
            can be written as < Title>, < TITLE>, or in any other
                way. This documentation can help you learn more about HTML.

        <p>
          HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your
          content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to
          enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a
          certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a
          word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can
          make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For example, take the
          following line of content:
        </p>
        <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>

        <p>
          If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it
          is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:
        </p>

        <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code>
      </article>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Nesting_elements">
      <header>Nesting elements</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called
          <strong>nesting.</strong> If we wanted to state that our cat is
          <strong>very</strong> grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a
          &lt;strong&gt; element, which means that the word is to be strongly
          emphasized:
        </p>

        <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;</code>

        <p>
          You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly
          nested. In the example above, we opened the &lt;p&gt; element first,
          then the &lt;strong&gt; element; therefore, we have to close the
          &lt;strong&gt; element first, then the &lt;p&gt; element. The
          following is incorrect:
        </p>

        <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</code>

        <p>
          The elements have to open and close correctly so that they are
          clearly inside or outside one another. If they overlap as shown
          above, then your web browser will try to make the best guess at what
          you were trying to say, which can lead to unexpected results. So
          don't do it!
        </p>

    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Empty_elements">
      <header>Empty elements</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          Some elements have no content and are called
          <strong>empty elements.</strong>
        </p>

        <code>&lt;img src="img/img-example.png" alt="My test image"&gt;</code>

        <p>
          This contains two attributes, but there is no closing &lt;/img&gt;
          tag and no inner content. This is because an image element doesn't
          wrap content to affect it. Its purpose is to embed an image in the
          HTML page in the place it appears.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Images">
      <header>Images</header>
      <article>
        <p>Let's turn our attention to the &lt;img&gt; element again:</p>

        <code>&lt;img src="img/img-example.png" alt="My test image"&gt;</code>

        <p>
          As we said before, it embeds an image into our page in the position
          it appears. It does this via the src (source) attribute, which
          contains the path to our image file.
        </p>

        <p>
          We have also included an alt (alternative) attribute. In this
          attribute, you specify descriptive text for users who cannot see the
          image, possibly because of the following reasons:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            They are visually impaired. Users with significant visual
            impairments often use tools called screen readers to read out the
            alt text to them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Something has gone wrong causing the image not to display. For
            example, try deliberately changing the path inside your src
            attribute to make it incorrect. If you save and reload the page,
            you should see something like this in place of the image:
            <img
              src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/alt-text-example.png"
              alt="example" />
          </li>
        </ol>
      </article>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Headings">
      <header>Headings</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your
          content are headings — or subheadings. In the same way that a book
          has the main title, chapter titles, and subtitles, an HTML document
          can too. HTML contains 6 heading levels, &lt;h1&gt;–&lt;h6&gt;,
          although you'll commonly only use 3 to 4 at most:
        </p>
        <code>&lt;h1&gt;My main title&lt;/h1&gt;
          &lt;h2&gt;My top level heading&lt;/h2&gt;
          &lt;h3&gt;My subheading&lt;/h3&gt;
          &lt;h4&gt;My sub-subheading&lt;/h4&gt;</code>
      </article>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Paragraphs">
      <header>Paragraphs</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          As explained above, &lt;p&gt; elements are for containing paragraphs
          of text; you'll use these frequently when marking up regular text
          content:
        </p>

        <code>&lt;p&gt;This is a single paragraph&lt;/p&gt;</code>
      </article>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Lists">
      <header>Lists</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          A lot of the web's content is lists and HTML has special elements
          for these. Marking up lists always consists of at least 2 elements.
          The most common list types are ordered and unordered lists:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Unordered lists are for lists where the order of the items doesn't
            matter, such as a shopping list. These are wrapped in a &lt;ul&gt;
            element.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ordered lists are for lists where the order of the items does
            matter, such as a recipe. These are wrapped in an &lt;ol&gt;
            element.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Each item inside the lists is put inside an &lt;li&gt; (list item)
          element.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if we wanted to turn the part of the following
          paragraph fragment into a list
        </p>

        <code>&lt;p&gt;At Mozilla, we’re a global community of technologists, thinkers, and builders.&lt;/p&gt;</code>

        <p>We could modify the markup to this</p>

        <code>&lt;p&gt;At Mozilla, we’re a global community of&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;technologists&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;thinkers&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;builders&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;/ul&gt;
        </code>

    <section class="main-section" id="Links">
      <header>Links</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          Links are very important — they are what makes the web a web! To add
          a link, we need to use a simple element — &lt;a&gt; — "a" being the
          short form for "anchor". To make text within your paragraph into a
          link, follow these steps:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Choose some text. We chose the text "Mozilla Manifesto".</li>
          <li>
            Wrap the text in an &lt;a&gt; element, as shown below:
            <code>&lt;a&gt;Mozilla Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            Give the &lt;a&gt; element an href attribute, as shown below:
            <code>&lt;a href=""&gt;Mozilla Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            Fill in the value of this attribute with the web address that you
            want the link to link to:
            <code>&lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/"&gt;Mozilla Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;</code>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </article>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="HTML_document">
      <header>HTML document</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          That wraps up the basics of individual HTML elements, but they
          aren't handy on their own. Now we'll look at how individual elements
          are combined to form an entire HTML page.
        </p>

        <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; 
          &lt;html&gt;
          &lt;head&gt;
          &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
          &lt;title>My test page&lt;/title&gt;
          &lt;/head&gt;
          &lt;body&gt; 
          &lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image"&gt;
          &lt;/body&gt;
          &lt;/html&gt;
        </code>

        <p>Here, we have the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; — doctype. It is a required preamble. In the
            mists of time, when HTML was young (around 1991/92), doctypes were
            meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to
            follow to be considered good HTML, which could mean automatic
            error checking and other useful things. However these days, they
            don't do much and are basically just needed to make sure your
            document behaves correctly. That's all you need to know for now.
          </li>

          <li>
            &lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt; — the &lt;html&gt; element. This element
            wraps all the content on the entire page and is sometimes known as
            the root element.
          </li>

          <li>
            &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; — the &lt;head&gt; element. This element
            acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the
            HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's
            viewers. This includes things like keywords and a page description
            that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our
            content, character set declarations, and more.
          </li>

          <li>
            &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt; — This element sets the character set
            your document should use to UTF-8 which includes most characters
            from the vast majority of written languages. Essentially, it can
            now handle any textual content you might put on it. There is no
            reason not to set this and it can help avoid some problems later
            on.
          </li>

          <li>
            &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt; — the &lt;title&gt; element. This sets
            the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the
            browser tab the page is loaded in. It is also used to describe the
            page when you bookmark/favorite it.
          </li>

          <li>
            &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt; — the &lt;body&gt; element. This
            contains all the content that you want to show to web users when
            they visit your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games,
            playable audio tracks, or whatever else.
          </li>
